# Dumb Computer Game
"Dumb Computer Game" (DCG) is basically a text-based match-based arena fighter with dynamically created enemy NPCs. 

# Background
I created it as an exercise in learning the Rust syntax.

This is just a dumb computer game based very loosely on a game my friend and I made in Qbasic as kids. I decided to create a similar game because I thought it would be fun to revisit the concept, remix it, and learn the Rust syntax in the process. 

# Progress
As of 2023-10-05 the "game" still requires a lot of work to implement all the features desired, but the core exercise of using the concept to learn the Rust syntax is complete.
